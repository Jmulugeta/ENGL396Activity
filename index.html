  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p>
    Hello, My name is Joseph Mulugeta. I am a Second Year Informatics & Soon to be Applying Computer Science student at the University of Washington. 
    I am working towards becoming a Software Engineer, and I think being able to document Software properly is a skill I am hoping to get out of this class, which is why I enroleed in this course.
  </p>
  <h2> My Experience at UW </h2>
  <p>
    As a second year studnet, I have had the opportunity tto take numerous classes at the University of Washington. I have developed and grown so much by being attentive in these courses, and following directions.  From taking the Intro CSE 12X Series, to Data Structures & Algorithms, 
    to Client Side Web Development, I think I have not only growed technically, but I have become more confident and driven towards becoming a Software Engineer.
